  The Ferdowsi Research Laboratory uses a combination of laboratory and numerical experiments, as well as theoretical and analytical studies, to better understand and more quantitatively predict the flow and deformation of Earth materials in (initial and transient loading, boundary) conditions relevant to Earth's near-surface processes. A major focus of the group currently is on the behavior of granular materials -- as well as other complex fluids and disordered solids that share some similarity in their structural properties and dynamical behavior with granular materials -- in dry, fluid-driven, saturated, and unsaturated conditions. For numerical methods, we use and collaborate to further develop, Discrete Element Method (DEM), DEM coupled to Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) method, DEM coupled to Finite Element Method (FEM) method, and Boundary Element Method (BEM). For laboratory experiments, we collaborate with classical rock and sediment friction and mechanics laboratories; we are also equipped with an advanced rheometery laboratory capable of performing rheology experiments on soft geometerials, granular materials, and complex fluids, in conditions relevant to Earth's near-surface. We also seek collaborations with field-going scientists, and more broadly across the disciplinary lines with geophysicists, geologists, engineers, applied mathematicians, computational scientists, social scientists.

     This theme allows an academic person to showcase their research interests, publications, research group, curriculum vitae, any courses that they may be teaching, or anything else they may want to put out into the world.

Academics can use this home page to describe their research interests, display their latest publications, or provide an introduction to their research group.
