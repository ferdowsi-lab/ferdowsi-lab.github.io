    <h3 class="fw-bold">Welcome!</h3>
The Ferdowsi Research Laboratory uses a combination of laboratory and numerical experiments, as well as theoretical and analytical studies, to better understand and more quantitatively predict the flow and deformation behavior (that is the scientific field of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheology" target="_blank">rheology</a>) of Earth materials in (initial and transient loading, boundary) conditions relevant to Earth's near-surface processes. A major focus of the group currently is on the behavior of granular materials -- and other complex fluids and disordered solids that share some similarity in their structural properties and dynamical behavior with granular materials -- in dry, fluid-driven, saturated, and unsaturated conditions. For numerical experiments, we use and collaborate to further develop, Discrete Element Method (DEM), DEM coupled to Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) method, DEM coupled to Finite Element Method (FEM) method, and Boundary Element Method (BEM). For laboratory experiments, we collaborate with classical rock and sediment friction and mechanics laboratories; we are also equipped with an advanced rheometery laboratory which is capable of performing (steady-state and transient) rheology experiments on soft geometerials, granular materials, and complex fluids, in conditions relevant to Earth's near-surface. We seek collaborations with field-going scientists, and are interested in collaborations across the disciplinary lines with geophysicists, geologists, engineers, applied mathematicians, computational scientists, social scientists, environmental policy researchers and scientists.<p>

  The lab is currently equipped with an advanced rheometer (an Anton Paar Modular Compact MCR 502e WESP, with fluid pressure cell, temperature control cell, several loading geometries, imaging and particle tracking setup, accelorometers). We also have a dedicated computational cluster (with ~800 CPU cores) for running numerical experiments, which is maintained by the <a href="https://hpedsi.uh.edu" target="_blank">Hewlett Packard Enterprise Data Science Institute (HPE DSI)</a> at the University of Houston.

	  <i> <font size="2"><b>Figure 1</b> illustrates some examples of granular materials that we study in numerical and laboratory experiments. Panel (A) shows the powdered materials produced due to wear of the two pieces of rock that are sheared across each other. This is an image from Professor Terry Tullis's experimental rock friction laboratory in the Department of Earth, Environmental and Planetary Sciences at Brown University. This powdered material is called the fault gouge in the earthquake and rock physics communities (Image is modified after Scruggs & Tullis, Tectonophysics, 1998). Panel (B) shows snapshot of a sample of sheared granular material realized in a DEM numerical experiment (Ferdowsi & Rubin, Journal of Geophysical Research-Solid Earth, 2020). Image sequences (C)-(E) illustrate two styles of flow (slow creeping motion well below the surface and faster dense flow close to surface) of granular materials in sand pile experiments performed by Komatsu et al., 2001 (Image is modified after Komatsu et al., Physical Review Letters, 2001).</font></i>

	  So, why do we study flow and deformation of Earth materials and granular materials? I (Behrooz) has a few main reasons that I will explain here. As the laboratory grows, these motivations will be updated based on the interests and with collaboration of other members of the lab. For the first reason, I have been intensely curious<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> about various aspects of the behavior of Earth materials that are granular or those that have a disordered and granular-like structure. My second reason is derived from this first reason: we still know very little about various important aspects (structural and dynamical) of the behavior of granular geomaterials<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>. My research and research of other researchers in our field show that an improved understanding of the behavior of granular materials is crucial for developing physics-based models<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> for broad categories of earth materials. Specifically and as an example, my most recent research (with <a href="https://geosciences.princeton.edu/people/allan-m-rubin" target="_blank"> Allan M. Rubin</a>, my former postdoctoral advisor in the Department of Geosciences at Princeton University) shows that a transient frictional response that many geomaterials show (known as the rate- and state-dependent friction) can be a granular physics phenomenon. This transient frictional response is key to the initiation of almost all geological instabilities and natural hazards with a frictional origin, including landslides and earthflows, sliding of glaciers and nucleation of icequakes, earthquake nucleation, volcanic caldera collapse; we also currently have no other physics-based model or phenomenology that can explain the transient (rate- and state-dependent frictional) response, as seen in the lab, at least for rock shear zones. So, improving our predictive capabilities for frictional geological hazards and processes becomes an emerging motivation for this research.

 <div class="col-md-12">
In addition to the aforementioned motivations, we are also broadly interested in understanding the physics and chemistry of the processes that shape and change the Earth's surface over short (~human life) and long (geological) timescales. These include the physics (or physical-chemistry) of sediment transport in rivers and streams, and soil transport and soil production, both of which are important phenomena for forecasting changes of the Earth's surface. Soil and sediment transport phenomena are also not too distant from granular physics, because most soils at some scale are made of grains; sediment transport in rivers or fluvial settings is a hydrogranular process.

 This description is to be completed with links and information to my past and ongoing research in the aforementioned research topics. For now, you can check my publication page, or reach out to me directly via email, if you are interested in discussing about any of these areas for research or for potential collaboration.

<i> <font size="2">Figure 2: Granular Physics in the Ground Beneath our Feet: Panels (A-D) show example geological hazards and processes where transient frictional response (rate- and state-dependent friction) of a localized shear zone play crucial role (in most cases, it fully controls) in the onset of sliding and mode of instability. Panel (A) is an image of the 2005 La Conchita landslide in the town of La Conchita, California (image credit to the US Geological Survey, USGS). Panel B shows the San Andreas Fault in San Luis Obispo County in California (image credit Tom Bean, CORBIS). Panel (C) shows the formation of subglacial debris (basal till) that has melted out from the dark striped basal ice layer (Photo credit M. J. Hambrey, 1987; https://www.swisseduc.ch). Panel (D) is an aerial photograph that looks west across Kilauea Volcano's summit on June 12, 2018, after the onset of the caldera collapse (image credit: Kyle Anderson U.S. Geological Survey; see this  <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-tiny-leak-led-to-a-massive-unexpected-collapse-at-kilauea-volcano/" target="_blank">Scientific American</a> article for more information).

Panels (F) and (G) illustrate the development of convex, rounded hillslopes and ridge-and-valley topography in soil-mantled terrain (hillslopes), which Dietrich and Perron argue in their 2006 Nature paper, can be the result of a particular (empirical) form of soil tranport (constitutive) law (photo credit of panel F is to Daniel Hobley; photo credit of panel G is to J. Kirchner, modified from  Dietrich & Perron, Nature 2006).</font></i>
