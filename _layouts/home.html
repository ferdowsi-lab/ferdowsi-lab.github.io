  The Ferdowsi Research Laboratory uses a combination of laboratory and numerical experiments, as well as theoretical and analytical studies, to better understand and more quantitatively predict the flow and deformation of Earth materials in (initial and transient loading, boundary) conditions relevant to Earth's near-surface processes. A major focus of the group currently is on the behavior of granular materials -- as well as other complex fluids and disordered solids that share some similarity in their structural properties and dynamical behavior with granular materials -- in dry, fluid-driven, saturated, and unsaturated conditions. For numerical methods, we use and collaborate to further develop, Discrete Element Method (DEM), DEM coupled to Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) method, DEM coupled to Finite Element Method (FEM) method, and Boundary Element Method (BEM). For laboratory experiments, we collaborate with classical rock and sediment friction and mechanics laboratories; we are also equipped with an advanced rheometery laboratory capable of performing rheology experiments on soft geometerials, granular materials, and complex fluids, in conditions relevant to Earth's near-surface. We also seek collaborations with field-going scientists, and more broadly across the disciplinary lines with geophysicists, geologists, engineers, applied mathematicians, computational scientists, social scientists.

<i> <font size="2">Figure 1 are some examples of granular materials in numerical and laboratory experiments. Panel (A) shows the powdered rock produced due to wear of the two pieces of rock that are sheared across each other, in Professor Terry Tullis's experimental rock friction laboratory at Brown University. This powdered material is called the fault gouge in the earthquake and rock physics communities (Figure is modified from Scruggs & Tullis, Tectonophysics, 1998). Panel (B) shows snapshot of a sheared granular material sample realized with a DEM numerical experiment (Ferdowsi & Rubin, Journal of Geophysical Research-Solid Earth, 2020). Image sequences (C)-(E) illustrate slow deformation and creeping motion of granular materials in subsurface and the faster (dense) flow of the matter in granular (sand) pile experiment (modified from Komatsu et al., Physical Review Letters, 2001).</font></i><p><br>
