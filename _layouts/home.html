    <h3 class="fw-bold">Welcome!</h3>
  The Ferdowsi Research Laboratory uses a combination of laboratory and numerical experiments, as well as theoretical and analytical studies, to better understand and more quantitatively predict the flow and deformation (that is the scientific field of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheology" target="_blank">Rheology</a>) of Earth materials in (initial and transient loading, boundary) conditions relevant to Earth's near-surface processes. A major focus of the group currently is on the behavior of granular materials -- as well as other complex fluids and disordered solids that share some similarity in their structural properties and dynamical behavior with granular materials -- in dry, fluid-driven, saturated, and unsaturated conditions. For numerical methods, we use and collaborate to further develop, Discrete Element Method (DEM), DEM coupled to Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) method, DEM coupled to Finite Element Method (FEM) method, and Boundary Element Method (BEM). For laboratory experiments, we collaborate with classical rock and sediment friction and mechanics laboratories; we are also equipped with an advanced rheometery laboratory capable of performing rheology experiments on soft geometerials, granular materials, and complex fluids, in conditions relevant to Earth's near-surface. We also seek collaborations with field-going scientists, and more broadly across the disciplinary lines with geophysicists, geologists, engineers, applied mathematicians, computational scientists, social scientists, environmental policy researchers and scientists.<p>

  In addition to the advanced rheometer (an Anton Paar Modular Compact Rheometer MCR 502e WESP, with fluid pressure cell, temperature control cell, several loading geometries, imaging and particle tracking setup, accelorometers), the lab is also equipped with a dedicated computational cluster (with ~800 CPU cores) maintained by the <a href="https://hpedsi.uh.edu" target="_blank">Hewlett Packard Enterprise Data Science Institute (HPE DSI)</a> at the University of Houston.

<i> <font size="2">Figure 1 illustrates some examples of granular materials that we study in numerical and laboratory experiments. Panel (A) shows the powdered materials produced due to wear of the two pieces of rock that are sheared across each other. This is an image from Professor Terry Tullis's experimental rock friction laboratory in the Department of Earth, Environmental and Planetary Sciences at Brown University. This powdered material is called the fault gouge in the earthquake and rock physics communities (Image is modified after Scruggs & Tullis, Tectonophysics, 1998). Panel (B) shows snapshot of a sample of sheared granular material realized in a DEM numerical experiment (Ferdowsi & Rubin, Journal of Geophysical Research-Solid Earth, 2020). Image sequences (C)-(E) illustrate two styles of flow (slow creeping motion well below the surface and faster dense flow close to surface) of granular materials in sand pile experiments performed by Komatsu et al., 2001 (Image is modified after Komatsu et al., Physical Review Letters, 2001).</font></i>

	  So, why do we study flow and deformation of Earth materials and granular materials? I (Behrooz) has a few primary reasons that I would be happy to explain here, and as the laboratory grows, these motivations will be updated based on the interests and with collaboration of other members of the lab. Behrooz's first reason has been curiosity, I have been intensely curious about various aspects of the behavior of Earth materials that are granular or those that have a disordered and granular-like structure.<p><br>

 My second reason is kind of derivative of this first reason: we still know very little about various important aspects of the behavior of granular geomaterials (note that the <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2021/press-release/" target="_blank">Noble Prize in Physics 2021</a>  has been awarded in part to Giorgio Parisi for his <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2021/10/advanced-physicsprize2021.pdf" target="_blank">scientific discoveries</a> related to advancing our fundamental understanding of the behavior of disordered solids, including granular materials), and what my research and research of many others in our field shows, is that an improved understanding of the behavior of granular materials, is crucial for developing physics-based (accurate and with an understanding of why a certain behavior emerges, or certain equations or components are included) models for flow and deformation of a broad range of earth materials. In particular, my most recent research (with <a href="https://geosciences.princeton.edu/people/allan-m-rubin" target="_blank"> Allan M. Rubin</a>, my former postdoctoral advisor in the Department of Geosciences at Princeton University) shows that a transient frictional response that many geomaterials in localized shear zones show (known as the rate- and state-dependent friction) can be a granular physics phenomenon. This transient frictional response is key to the initiation of almost all geological instabilities and hazards with a frictional origin, including landslides and earthflows, sliding of glaciers and nucleation of icequakes, earthquake nucleation, volcanic caldera collapse); we currently have no other reliable physics-based model or phenomenology that can explain the rate- and state-dependent friction as seen in the lab, at least for rock shear zones), so improving our predictive capabilities of these variety of geological hazards and processes that change (and/or are changing in response to natural forcings, climate change, anthropogenic forcing) the Earth's surface and the environment became a new emerging motivation for my research. <p>

 As a third reason, I am also broadly interested in understanding the physics and chemistry of the processes that shape and change the Earth's surface over short (~human life) and long (geological) timescales. These include the physics of sediment transport in rivers and streams, and physics of soil transport and soil production, both of which are important phenomena for forecasting changes of the Earth's surface over short and long timescales; soil and sediment transport topics are also not too distant from granular physics (soils at some scale are made of grains; sediment transport in rivers or fluvial setting is a hydrogranular process).

 This description is to be completed with links and information to my past and ongoing research in the aforementioned research topics. For now, you can check my publication page, or reach out to me directly via email, if you are interested in discussing about any of these areas for research or for potential collaboration.

<i> <font size="2">Figure 2: Granular Physics in the Ground Beneath our Feet: Panels (A-D) show example geological hazards and processes where transient frictional response (rate- and state-dependent friction) of a localized shear zone play crucial role (in most cases, it fully controls) in the onset of sliding and mode of instability. Panel (A) is an image of the 2005 La Conchita landslide in the town of La Conchita, California (image credit to the US Geological Survey, USGS). Panel B shows the San Andreas Fault in San Luis Obispo County in California (image credit Tom Bean, CORBIS). Panel (C) shows the formation of subglacial debris (basal till) that has melted out from the dark striped basal ice layer (Photo credit M. J. Hambrey, 1987; https://www.swisseduc.ch). Panel (D) is an aerial photograph that looks west across Kilauea Volcano's summit on June 12, 2018, after the onset of the caldera collapse (image credit: Kyle Anderson U.S. Geological Survey; see this  <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-tiny-leak-led-to-a-massive-unexpected-collapse-at-kilauea-volcano/" target="_blank">Scientific American</a> article for more information). Panel (E) is a photo of the Elwha river, a gravel-bedded river in the state of Washington (image credit to <a href="https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/habitat-conservation/river-habitat" target="_blank">the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Fisheries</a>; please also check the link for more information about the influence of gravel sorting and armoring (a granular pheneomnon where larger grain sizes tend to localize around each other) in riverbed structure on the river habitat. Panels (F) and (G) illustrate the development of convex, rounded hillslopes and ridge-and-valley topography in soil-mantled terrain (hillslopes), which Dietrich and Perron argue in their 2006 Nature paper, can be the result of a particular (empirical) form of soil tranport (constitutive) law (photo credit of panel F is to Daniel Hobley; photo credit of panel G is to J. Kirchner, modified from  Dietrich & Perron, Nature 2006).</font></i>
