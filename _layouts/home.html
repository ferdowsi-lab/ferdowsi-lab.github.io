  The Ferdowsi Research Laboratory uses a combination of laboratory and numerical experiments, as well as theoretical and analytical studies, to better understand and more quantitatively predict the flow and deformation (that is the scientific field of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheology" target="_blank">Rheology</a>) of Earth materials in (initial and transient loading, boundary) conditions relevant to Earth's near-surface processes. A major focus of the group currently is on the behavior of granular materials -- as well as other complex fluids and disordered solids that share some similarity in their structural properties and dynamical behavior with granular materials -- in dry, fluid-driven, saturated, and unsaturated conditions. For numerical methods, we use and collaborate to further develop, Discrete Element Method (DEM), DEM coupled to Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) method, DEM coupled to Finite Element Method (FEM) method, and Boundary Element Method (BEM). For laboratory experiments, we collaborate with classical rock and sediment friction and mechanics laboratories; we are also equipped with an advanced rheometery laboratory capable of performing rheology experiments on soft geometerials, granular materials, and complex fluids, in conditions relevant to Earth's near-surface. We also seek collaborations with field-going scientists, and more broadly across the disciplinary lines with geophysicists, geologists, engineers, applied mathematicians, computational scientists, social scientists.

<i> <font size="2">Figure 1 illustrates some examples of granular materials that we study in numerical and laboratory experiments. Panel (A) shows the powdered materials produced due to wear of the two pieces of rock that are sheared across each other. This is an image from Professor Terry Tullis's experimental rock friction laboratory in the Department of Earth, Environmental and Planetary Sciences at Brown University. This powdered material is called the fault gouge in the earthquake and rock physics communities (Image is modified after Scruggs & Tullis, Tectonophysics, 1998). Panel (B) shows snapshot of a sample of sheared granular material realized in a DEM numerical experiment (Ferdowsi & Rubin, Journal of Geophysical Research-Solid Earth, 2020). Image sequences (C)-(E) illustrate two styles of flow (slow creeping motion well below the surface and faster dense flow close to surface) of granular materials in sand pile experiments performed by Komatsu et al., 2001 (Image is modified after Komatsu et al., Physical Review Letters, 2001).</font></i><p><br>

	 So, why do we study flow and deformation of Earth materials and granular materials? I (Behrooz) has a few primary reasons that I would be happy to explain here, and as the laboratory grows, these motivations will be updated based on the interests and with collaboration of other members of the lab. Behrooz's first reason has been curiosity, I have been intensely curious about various aspects of the behavior of Earth materials that are granular or those that have a disordered and granular-like structure. My second reason is kind of derivative of this first reasons: we still know very little about various aspects of the behavior of granular materials (note that the <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2021/press-release/" target="_blank">Noble Prize in Physics 2021</a>  has been awarded in part to Giorgio Parisi for his <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2021/10/advanced-physicsprize2021.pdf" target="_blank">scientific discoveries</a> related to advancing our fundamental understanding of the behavior of disordered solids, including granular materials), and what my research and research of many others in our field shows, is that an improved understanding of the behavior of granular materials and similar earth materials, is crucial for physics-based (accurate and with an understanding of why a certain behavior emerges, or certain equations or components are included in a model) modeling of the behavior of geomaterials.
