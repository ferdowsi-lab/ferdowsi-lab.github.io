<p><b><font size="4", color="black">Open positions:</font></b> We are looking for enthusiastic postdocs and students to join our research laboratory at the University of Houston. If you are interested in working with us, please contact Behrooz at bferdowsi@uh.edu .</p><br>


<p><b><font size="4", color="blue">Graduate students</font></b></br>Funded Ph.D. positions are available in the Ferdowsi Research Laboratory within the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of Houston. Positions are available with start date as early as Spring 2022 and Fall 2022. Some of our active research areas include experimental and computational mechanics of Earth materials, rheology of Earth materials, granular mechanics, physics-based modeling and quantitative studies of Earth's near-surface processes. Applications are welcomed from students with bachelor’s or master’s degree in Earth Science, Environmental Science, Geology, Geophysics, Physics, Civil and Environmental Engineering, Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Applied Mathematics, or related fields. A strong background or a strong interest in granular physics, solid mechanics, fluid mechanics, and some experience in either of computer programming, high performance computing, discrete element method, molecular dynamics or atomistic simulations, computational fluid dynamics (CFD), experimental investigation for rheology of soft materials and complex fluids, soil mechanics, rock friction and deformation experiments, is a plus. The research projects will be designed in collaboration with the students and will be motivated by their interests and career goals, within the general research areas of the laboratory. There are also opportunities for collaboration with researchers and faculty at the <a href="http://ncalm.cive.uh.edu" target="_blank">National Center for Airborne Laser Mapping (NCALM)</a>, and that can connect small-scale modeling and laboratory-scale studies to geological-scale and remote sensing observations. 

The interested candidates are encouraged to (i) apply directly to the <a href="http://www.cive.uh.edu/admissions/civil-engineering" target="_blank">Ph.D. programs in Civil and Environmental Engineering</a> and (ii) fill out the application form below:</p>

<p><a href="https://forms.gle/CHgZR8zbNpBDt9EW7" target="_blank">https://forms.gle/CHgZR8zbNpBDt9EW7</a></p>

<p>In the application form, you can request a meeting time with me if you would like to disucss about research ideas and the lab, before submitting a formal application. Feel free to reach out to me at bferdowsi@uh.edu if you have any questions.</a></p>

<p>I strongly encourage applications from members of under-represented groups or members of groups typically under-represented and minoritized in STEM fields, Earth and Planetary Science, and higher education. The University of Houston embraces diversity and recognizes our responsibility to foster an open, welcoming environment where students, faculty and staff of all backgrounds can collaboratively learn, work and serve: <a href="https://uh.edu/diversity-equity-inclusion/" target="_blank">https://uh.edu/diversity-equity-inclusion/</a></p>

<p>Review of applications will start immediately and will continue until the positions are filled.</p><br>



<p><b><font size="4", color="blue">Undergraduate students</font></b></br> We welcome undergraduate students interested in working in our laboratory on a research project, as part of a summer research fellowship, or simply to gain research experience. Please contact me directly at bferdowsi@uh.edu and briefly describe your background and interests. University of Houston students interested in summer research are encouraged to contact me at bferdowsi@uh.edu to work together on an application for the <a href="https://uh.edu/honors/undergraduate-research/our-programs/surf/" target="_blank">Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF)</a> program.</p><br>
