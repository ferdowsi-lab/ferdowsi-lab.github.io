I, on behalf of myself, Benjamin Alessio and Allan Rubin, will give an in-person podium presentation at The Society of Rheology (SoR) 92nd Annual Meeting in Bangor, Maine on Monday October 11, 2021. The title of our talk is "How much of the transient rheological behavior of geological shear zones can be explained using granular physics alone?" and it is on Monday, October 11, 3:45 pm (Maine time), Meeting Room C-D (Track 4). I thank Dr. Antonio Perazzo, co-chair of the SoR session on Flow-induced Instabilities and Non-Newtonian Fluids, for their invitation.
