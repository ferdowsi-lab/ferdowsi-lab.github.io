I participated in the Gordon Research Seminar and Conference (GRS and GRC) Granular Matter that was held in Stonehill College, Easton, MA, in June 2022. In this meeting, I was a discussion leader for the GRS session on "Frontiers of Granular Matter Engineering", thanks to an invitation from GRS Chairs, Drs. Ishan Srivastava and Jennifer M. Rieser, I also presented a poster (on behalf of myself, Prof. Allan Rubin, and Benjamin M. Alessio) at GRC which was titled "Jamming or not, and rate-state friction or not, in 2D and 3D DEM simulations of granular layers with Hertzian and Hookean contacts". Our poster was selected for a GRC poster award, along with two other excellent GRC poster awardees, Dr. Olfa D'Angelo of Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-NÃ¼rnberg and Dr. Eric Breard of The University of Edinburgh. I and the other GRC poster awardees each also delivered a 15 minutes talk in the last session of the GRC meeting.
