title: "Seminar at the Department of Earth, Environmental and Planetary Sciences, Rice University"
---

I gave a Department Seminar (virtually, due to covid-related risks and restrictions) at the Department of Earth, Environmental and Planetary Sciences, Rice University on September 16, 2021. I also very much enjoyed the in-person visit to the department and the discussions with students, postdoctoral researchers, and faculty on September 21, 2021! I would like to thank Professors Juli Morgan, Melodie French, and Fenglin Niu for inviting me and for being my host during the visit.
