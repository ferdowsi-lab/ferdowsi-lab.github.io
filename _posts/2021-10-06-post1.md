I delivered an in-person talk at the APS March Meeting in Chicago, IL, in the focus session on Nonlinear Response of Complex Granular Materials, chaired by Dr. Ishan Srivastava of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The title of our talk was "Transient rheology and the direct velocity effect in simulated sheared granular materials".
