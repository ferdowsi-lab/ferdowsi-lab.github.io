<p><strong>Academic biography and facts</strong>: Behrooz Ferdowsi is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of Houston, where he leads a newly established research group on the rheology of Earth materials and physics of Earth’s near-surface processes. Behrooz obtained his Ph.D. in Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering from ETH Zurich in Switzerland and his M.Sc. in Civil Engineering from Tehran Polytechnic in Iran. In his PhD research, he worked on understanding the mechanism of triggering of stick-slip instabilities in sheared granular materials using computational methods. For his first postdoctoral appointment, he was based (jointly) in the Department of Earth and Environmental Science at the University of Pennsylvania and in the National Center for Earth-surface Dynamics at the University of Minnesota. During this period, he worked on granular physics of sediment transport in fluvial (rivers and streams) systems and on further understanding the physical basis of the empirical transport laws used for modeling the evolution of landscapes over geological timescale. This is followed by his second appointment as a Harry H. Hess fellow of the Department of Geosciences at Princeton University, during which he worked on understanding the physical origin of an empirical constitutive modeling framework, known as the rate- and state-dependent friction. This framework is commonly used for modeling the transient friction of rocks and other geological materials, including ice-on-ice and ice-on-rock friction, and it is also used for simulating the sliding of glaciers and the nucleation of icequakes. Behrooz is a regular member of the American Physical Society, American Association for the Advancement of Science, American Geophysical Union, Society of Rheology, Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, National Association of Geoscience Teachers, and the Earth Science Women’s Network.</p>

<p><strong>Personal facts</strong>: Beside science related to my research program, I also enjoy reading about the history of science and reading and learning about the American history. I drink a LOT OF coffee (espresso and brewed) per day, and I can spend hours (in my free time) looking at and trying to understand beautiful landscape paintings. Some of my favorite landscape painting artists until nowadays are <a href="https://www.sfmoma.org/artist/richard_mayhew/">Richard Mayhew</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julie_Mehretu">Julie Mehretu</a>. If you like, you can also watch <a href="https://youtu.be/KlYbStrFOuc">a short interview with Richard and Julie</a>. Some other random personal facts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I used to play two Persian musical instruments: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setar">setar</a>, which I played rather professionally for nearly eigth years, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_(string_instrument)">tar</a>, which I played for about two years. I no longer play those instruments, partly because of not having access to them (moving from Scotland &gt; Switzerland &gt; Canada &gt; US was a relatively long journey to be thinking about carrying instruments for me), and partly because I grow to really like western music (I like Opera in classical music, and Blues, Alternative/Indie (pop), pop rock, hip hop, among various music genres), so instead of playing (which took hours of my time when I played professionally), I now listen to music that others play and songs that others write.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I don’t have a particularly strong gender identity, a situation that I came to fully understand only in recent years. I could use any pronouns (he/they) and I am comfortable being called with any of the pronouns. One of the interesting facts about my native language (Farsi/Persian) is that pronouns are gender-neutral, so I didn’t have to think about this aspect of life (what to be called) too much before getting completely used to the US English.</p>
