I"à<p>I gave a Department Seminar (virtualy, due to covid-related risks and restrictions) at the Department of Earth, Environmental and Planetary Sciences, Rice University on September 16, 2021. I also visited the Department on September 21, 2021 in-person! I very much enjoyed the visit and the discussion with faculty and students. I also would like to thank Professors Juli Morgan, Melodie French, and Fenglin Niu for their invitation and for being my host during this visit.</p>
