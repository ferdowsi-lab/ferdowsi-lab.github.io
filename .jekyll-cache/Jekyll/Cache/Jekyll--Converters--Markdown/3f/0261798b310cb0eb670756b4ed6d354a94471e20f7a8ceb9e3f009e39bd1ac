I"∫<p>I participated in the Gordon Research Seminar and Conference (GRS and GRC) Granular Matter that was held in Stonehill College, Easton, MA, in June 2022. In this meeting, I was a discussion leader for the GRS session on ‚ÄúFrontiers of Granular Matter Engineering‚Äù, thanks to an invitation from GRS Chairs, Drs. Ishan Srivastava and Jennifer M. Rieser, I also presented a poster (on behalf of myself, Prof. Allan Rubin, and Benjamin M. Alessio) at GRC which was titled ‚ÄúJamming or not, and rate-state friction or not, in 2D and 3D DEM simulations of granular layers with Hertzian and Hookean contacts‚Äù. Our poster was selected for a GRC poster award, along with two other excellent GRC poster awardees, Dr. Olfa D‚ÄôAngelo of Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-N√ºrnberg and Dr. Eric Breard of The University of Edinburgh. I and the other GRC poster awardees each also delivered a 15 minutes talk in the last session of the GRC meeting.</p>
