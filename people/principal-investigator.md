**Academic biography and facts**: Behrooz Ferdowsi is an Assistant Professor (Sept. 2021 - present) in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of Houston, where he leads a newly established research group on the rheology of Earth materials and physics of Earthâ€™s near-surface processes. Behrooz obtained his Ph.D. in Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering from ETH Zurich in Switzerland and his M.Sc. in Civil Engineering from Tehran Polytechnic in Iran. In his PhD research, he worked on understanding the mechanism of triggering of stick-slip instabilities in sheared granular materials using computational methods. For his first postdoctoral appointment, he was based (jointly) in the Department of Earth and Environmental Science at the University of Pennsylvania and in the National Center for Earth-surface Dynamics at the University of Minnesota. During this period, he worked on granular physics of sediment transport in fluvial (rivers and streams) systems and on further understanding the physical basis of the empirical transport laws used for modeling the evolution of landscapes over geological timescale. This is followed by his second appointment as a Harry H. Hess fellow of the Department of Geosciences at Princeton University, during which he worked on understanding the physical origin of an empirical constitutive modeling framework, known as the rate- and state-dependent friction. This framework is commonly used for modeling the transient friction of rocks and other geological materials, including ice-on-ice and ice-on-rock friction, and it is also used for simulating the sliding of glaciers and the nucleation of icequakes. Behrooz is a regular member of the American Physical Society, American Association for the Advancement of Science, American Geophysical Union, Society of Rheology, Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, National Association of Geoscience Teachers, and the Earth Science Women's Network.

**Personal facts**: Besides science and research in my core research program, I enjoy reading and listening (audiobooks) about the history of science and about the American history. I drink A LOT OF coffee (espresso and brewed) per day. In my free time, I occasionally spend hours looking at and trying to understand beautiful landscape paintings. Some of my favorite artists until nowadays are [Richard Mayhew](https://www.sfmoma.org/artist/richard_mayhew/) and [Julie Mehretu](https://walkerart.org/collections/artists/julie-mehretu). If you like, you can watch [a short interview with Richard and Julie](https://youtu.be/KlYbStrFOuc). Some other random personal facts:

* I used to play two Persian traditional musical instruments: [setar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setar), which I played rather professionally (meaning sometime for a public audience) for nearly eigth years, and [tar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_(string_instrument)), which I played for about two years in practicing phase. I no longer play those instruments, partly because I didn't have access to them (moving from Scotland > Switzerland > Canada > US was a relatively long journey to be thinking about carrying instruments for me; yes, I anticipated my moves across different countries early on in my academic journey), and partly because I grew to really like Western music. Nowadays, I enjoy listening to operas in classical music (no particular favorites yet; I started listening by following the opera playlist of the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg: https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/my-favorite-records-ruth-bader-ginsburg), and Blues, Alternative/Indie (pop), pop rock, hip hop, among various music genres.

* I am a big fan of all things Philadelphia (Philly as the city is informally called in the US)! I really like the city, its people, culture, museums, history. It is also the first city I lived in in the US. I also cannot start or end my day (depending on when I will find free time) without listening to [Fresh Air](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresh_Air), which is often hosted by [Terry Gross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Gross), always broadcasted from Philadelphia!

* I used to do (I guess the right verb is "draw", but I am not sure) [Persian calligraphy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_calligraphy) up to my college years. I no longer have time for calligraphy but I still enjoy seeing this unique form of art.
