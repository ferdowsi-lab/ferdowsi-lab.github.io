<p><strong>Biography</strong><br /> 
Behrooz Ferdowsi is an Assistant Professor (Sept. 2021 - present) in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of Houston, where he leads a newly established research group on the rheology of Earth materials and physics of Earth’s near-surface processes. He obtained his PhD in Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering from ETH Zurich in Switzerland and his M.Sc. in Civil Engineering from Tehran Polytechnic in Iran. In his PhD research, he worked on understanding the mechanism of triggering of stick-slip instabilities in sheared granular materials using computational methods. For his first postdoctoral appointment, he was based (jointly) in the Department of Earth and Environmental Science at the University of Pennsylvania and in the National Center for Earth-surface Dynamics at the University of Minnesota. During this period, he worked on granular physics of sediment transport in fluvial (rivers and streams) systems and creep in soil and sedimentary materials, and on further understanding the physical basis of the empirical transport laws used for modeling/predicting the evolution of landscapes over geological timescale. This is followed by his second appointment as a Harry H. Hess fellow of the Department of Geosciences at Princeton University, during which he primarily worked on granular rheology and on understanding the physical basis of an empirical constitutive modeling framework for transient rheology of rocks and other geological materials (including glacial till and glacier’s basal shear zone materials, ice-on-ice and ice-on-rock/sediment interfaces, landslide shear zone materials) known as the rate- and state-dependent friction.</p>

<p><strong>Personal facts</strong><br /> 
Besides science and research in my core research program, I enjoy reading and listening (audiobooks) about the history of science and about the American history. In my free time, I occasionally spend hours looking at and trying to understand some landscape paintings. Some of my favorite contemporary painters and illustrator artists until nowadays are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerhard_Richter">Gerhard_Richter</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Mayhew">Richard Mayhew</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julie_Mehretu">Julie Mehretu</a>. Some other personal facts (and opinions):</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I am a big fan of almost all things Philadelphia (Philly as the city is informally referred to). I really like the city, its people, culture, museums, and history. I believe I have been very fortunate that Philly has been the first place I lived in in the US. The city and its people provided me (a foreigner) a unique experience and perspective toward life and events in the US, from the place I was in, especially in years 2015 to (and including) 2017. I also really liked my time in New Jersey (NJ) as well as in Princeton, NJ.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I used to play two Persian traditional musical instruments: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setar">setar</a>, which I played rather professionally for nearly eigth years, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_(string_instrument)">tar</a>, which I played for about two years in practicing phase. I no longer play those instruments, partly because I didn’t have access to them (moving from Scotland -&gt; Switzerland -&gt; Canada -&gt; US was a relatively long journey, to be thinking about carrying instruments for me), and partly because I grew to really like Western music. Nowadays, I enjoy listening to operas in classical music, Blues, Alternative/Indie (pop), pop rock, hip hop, among various music genres. I would also very much like to learn playing a brass instrument (probably French Horn, Oboe, or Tuba) someday soon.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I used to do (I guess the right verb is “draw”, but I am not sure) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_calligraphy">Persian calligraphy</a> up to my college years. I no longer have time for calligraphy but I still enjoy seeing this unique form of art.</p>
