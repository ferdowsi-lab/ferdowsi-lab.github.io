    <h3 class="fw-bold">Welcome!</h3>
    <p> The Ferdowsi Research Laboratory at the University of Houston uses a combination of laboratory and numerical experiments, theoretical and analytical studies, to better understand and more quantitatively predict the flow and deformation (the scientific field of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheology" target="_blank">rheology</a>) of Earth materials in initial and transient loading and boundary conditions relevant to Earth's near-surface processes. A major focus of the group currently is on the behavior of granular geomaterials -- and other soft geomaterials, complex fluids, and disordered solids that share some similarity in their structural properties and dynamical behavior with granular materials -- in dry, fluid-driven, saturated, and unsaturated conditions. For numerical experiments, we use and collaborate to further develop, Discrete Element Method (DEM), DEM coupled to Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) method, DEM coupled to Finite Element Method (FEM) method, and Boundary Element Method (BEM). For laboratory experiments, we collaborate with classical rock and sediment friction and mechanics laboratories; we are also equipped with an advanced rheometery laboratory which is capable of performing steady-state and transient rheology experiments on soft geometerials, granular materials, and complex fluids, in conditions relevant to Earth's near-surface. We seek collaborations with field-going scientists, and are excited for working across the disciplinary interfaces with geophysicists, geologists, engineers, applied mathematicians, computational scientists, social scientists, environmental policy researchers and scientists.</p>

    The lab is based in the <a href="http://www.cive.uh.edu" target="_blank">Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering</a> at <a href="https://www.uh.edu" target="_blank">the University of Houston</a>. It is currently equipped with an advanced rheometer (an Anton Paar Modular Compact MCR 502e WESP, with fluid pressure cell, temperature control cell, several loading geometries, imaging and particle tracking setup, accelorometers). We also have a dedicated computational cluster (with ~800 CPU cores) which is maintained by the <a href="https://hpedsi.uh.edu" target="_blank">Hewlett Packard Enterprise Data Science Institute (HPE DSI)</a> at the University of Houston.

	  <p>	  So, why do we study flow and deformation of Earth materials and granular materials? I (Behrooz) has a few main reasons that I will explain here. As the laboratory grows, these motivations will be updated based on the interests and with collaboration of other members of the lab. For the first reason, I have been intensely curious<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> about various aspects of the behavior of Earth materials that are granular or those that have a disordered and granular-like structure. My second reason is derived from this first reason: it turns out we still know very little about various important aspects (structural and dynamical) of the behavior of granular geomaterials<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>. My research and research of other scientists and engineers in our field show that an improved understanding of the behavior of granular materials is crucial for developing physics-based models<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> for broad categories of earth materials. Specifically, my most recent research with <a href="https://geosciences.princeton.edu/people/allan-m-rubin" target="_blank">Allan M. Rubin</a>, my former postdoctoral advisor in the <a href="https://geosciences.princeton.edu" target="_blank">Department of Geosciences at Princeton University</a>, suggests that a transient frictional response that many geomaterials show (known as the rate- and state-dependent friction [<a href="https://prod-earthquake.cr.usgs.gov/static/lfs/research/rockphysics/prediction.pdf" target="_blank">Dieterich & Kilgore, PNAS, 1996</a>; <a href="https://personal.ems.psu.edu/~cjm38/papers_talks/Marone_AnnRevEPSL1998.pdf" target="_blank">Marone, Annu. Rev. Earth Planet. Sci, 1998</a>]; the behavior is a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature10589" target="_blank">materials science phenomenon [Li et al., Nature, 2011]</a> and is not limited to earth materials) can be a granular physics phenomenon. This transient frictional response is key to the initiation of almost all geological instabilities and natural hazards with a frictional origin, including landslides and earthflows, sliding of glaciers and nucleation of icequakes, earthquake nucleation, volcanic caldera collapse. Further, we currently have no other physics-based model or phenomenology that can explain this transient frictional response as seen in the lab, at least for rock shear zones. As a result, improving our predictive capabilities for geological hazards and geoprocesses has become an emerging motivation for our research in the last few years.</p>

	  <p>In addition to the reasons above, we are broadly interested in understanding the physics and chemistry of the processes that shape and change the Earth's surface in short (~human life) and long (geological) timescales. These include the physics of sediment transport in rivers, and soil production and transport. Both processes are fundamental to our quantitative understanding of the changes of the Earth's near-surface. Soil and sediment transport phenomena are also not too far from granular physics, because most soils at some length-scales are made of grains, and sediment transport is a hydrogranular process.</p>

	  <p>This description is to be completed with links and information to some of our past and ongoing research. For now, you can check my publication page. Please also feel free to reach out to me directly via email if you are interested in discussing any of these research areas, if you are a student looking for research opportunities, or if you are a PI interested in potential collaboration.</p>

Panels (A-D) show example geological hazards and processes where transient frictional response (rate- and state-dependent friction) of a localized shear zone play crucial role (in most cases, it fully controls) the onset of sliding and mode of instability. Panel (A) is an image of the 2005 La Conchita landslide in the town of La Conchita, California (image credit to the US Geological Survey, USGS). Panel B shows the San Andreas Fault in San Luis Obispo County in California (image credit Tom Bean, CORBIS).
